# Project Charter

## 1. Introduction

This project aims at creating a modern and fully functional e-commerce website for a local bike shop. The website will allow customers to browse bikes, accessories, and parts, check availability, and make secure online purchases. It will also include tools for booking maintenance services, scheduling test rides, and directly contacting the shop.  

The main goal is to provide a digital platform that enhances customer experience and expands the shop’s reach to a wider audience through a convenient, accessible, and user-friendly website.

### 2.1 Objective

A fully functional e-commerce website will be up and running by the end of the term, featuring:

- A secure online payment system  
- Booking functionality for maintenance services and test rides  
- Admin tools for product and service management  
- Responsive and modern design accessible on all devices

## 3. Milestones

- Decide on technologies for front-end (Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS), back-end (FastAPI), database (MongoDB), and services (Stripe for payments, Cloudinary for media, Vercel for deployment). Set up the project repository with proper branch structure and initial configuration.  
- Plan and sketch UI/UX on Figma for key pages such as Home, Product Catalog, Product Details, Booking, and Contact. Create mockups and component hierarchy to guide development.  
- Design API endpoints, database schema, and data flow. Outline how products, orders, and bookings will be stored and retrieved, ensuring security and scalability.  
- Determine how Stripe payments will work and how Cloudinary will store and serve product images. Document secure handling of environment variables and credentials.  
- Outline how users will book maintenance services and test rides. Define deployment steps on Vercel and how end-to-end testing will be conducted once development starts.
