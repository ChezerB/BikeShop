Bike Shop Website 

Problem: 

Many local bike shops face challenges in reaching a wider customer base because they lack a strong online presence. Customers often have difficulty browsing available bikes, checking prices, or finding accessories and parts online. Additionally, booking maintenance services or checking availability requires phone calls or in-person visits, which can be inconvenient and time-consuming. Without an accessible and organized online platform, shops risk losing potential customers to competitors who offer seamless digital shopping experiences. 

  

Solution: 

Our website provides a comprehensive digital solution for both customers and the bike shop. Customers can browse the full catalog of bikes, accessories, and parts with detailed descriptions and images, add items to a shopping cart, and complete secure online purchases. The website also allows users to book maintenance services, schedule test rides, and contact the shop directly for inquiries. Promotions, new arrivals, and special events can be highlighted dynamically, increasing engagement and customer retention. Overall, the platform simplifies the shopping and service process, creating a modern, user-friendly experience that supports the shopâ€™s growth. 

  

Technologies Required: 

Our website will be built using Next.js and React for the frontend, styled with Tailwind CSS, with MongoDB as the database, Stripe for payment processing, Cloudinary for hosting product images, and deployed on Vercel. This stack enables a fully functional, responsive, and scalable web application that meets modern e-commerce standards.
