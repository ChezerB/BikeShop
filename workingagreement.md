# Working Agreement

### Communication

Method of communication: We will be using discord for the team communication, and MS Teams/Outlook if we need to communicate with the professor.


Communication Timeline: Try to ensure a response to a fellow team member within 24 hours.


Meetings: One meeting per week, date will be dependent on what day is best for all members during that week.
If a member has to miss a meeting and it cannot be rescheduled, the present team members will inform them on what was discussed, and the absent member will have the opprotunity to provide feedback via text after the meeting


### Team Decision Making

During our meetings, we will ensure everyone gets an equal opprotunity to share their input on whatever we are discussing. Following our discussion, if we cannot come to a consensus on what we are going to do, we will use a majority vote system.

All team member opinions should be respected and accepted. If any group member disagrees with a decision, they are expected to share their thoughts in a respectful manner and make suggestions on what they think should be done differently.


### Roles and Responsibilites 

All members will follow their given roles and responsibilites. If any team member requires assistance on their part, we will help them to the best of our ability.

### Consequences

If a member is not respectful, does not contribute to their expected responsibilites, or miss multiple meetings without providing a valid reason, they will risk being reported to the instructor.
